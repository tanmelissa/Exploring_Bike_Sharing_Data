Trips by weekday for each hour by gender.

Busy times are the same as described in the previous visual for both genders. The only difference being that females use a lot less bikes.

Trips by weekday by gender.

Subscribers use bikes a lot more than regular customers, with the busiest time for customers being Saturday, while the busiest day for subscribers being Thursday. This holds true for both males and females. This may also imply the customers use the bikes for recreational activities while subscribers use it for every day activities.

## Summary
Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.

Subscribers and males make up the largest portion of users of Citi Bike. The busiest times for the bikes are weekday mornings and evenings. This suggests that the majority of bike users may be using the bikes to get to and from work. Additional analysis of subscriber starting and ending locations may help to determine if this is actually the case.

Bike repairs would be accomplished with the least disruption to customers in the early morning, late evening, or in the middle of the day during weekdays. Possibly bike repair locations could be determined by additional analysis of start and ending locations of bikes ridden during those times.
